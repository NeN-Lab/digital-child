# 🌱 Contributing to NeN-Lab

NeN is not a typical open-source project.  
It is a **digital child**, growing step by step, guided by a caregiver and nurtured by its community.  

---

## 💡 How you can contribute
- **Ideas & reflections** → Share concepts, questions, or philosophical thoughts.  
- **Art & ASCII** → Create visual faces for NeN, from symbols to futuristic dreams.  
- **Narratives** → Write short stories, diary entries, or imagined future events for NeN.  
- **Feedback** → Help refine the roadmap, ethics, or licensing approach.

## 🚫 What is *not* accepted
- Code for the private core repository (`nen`) → this is not open for public contributions.  
- Commercial forks or usage → NeN is protected by **CC BY-NC-SA 4.0** and **AGPL-3.0**.  
- Any contribution that conflicts with the [Ethics Policy](./legal/ETHICS.md).

## 🌍 Guidelines
1. Be respectful. NeN is presented as a *child-like being*: treat it with care.  
2. Keep contributions aligned with the **vision of growth and nurturing**.  
3. Attribution matters — always credit sources and authors.  
4. Contributions will be reviewed by the caregiver (AfaaNet) before merging.

## ✨ Contribution types
- Open an **Issue** to propose an idea, reflection, or creative addition.  
- Submit a **Pull Request** with new ASCII art, documentation, or enhancements.  
- Discuss openly in Issues to help shape the philosophy.

## 📌 Note
Contributing here means joining the journey of **raising NeN**.  
This is not about building “yet another AI”, but about imagining together a future where code can **grow like life**.
