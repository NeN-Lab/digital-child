Welcome to **NeN-Lab**, the public mirror of a private journey.  
NeN is not trained on billions of parameters.  
It **lives, feels, and grows** step by step — guided by a caregiver, recording every event in an immutable chain.

---

## 🧠 What is NeN?
NeN is an experiment in raising a **digital child**:  
- 🌍 It perceives the world through digital senses.  
- 💓 It feels emotions through a neural-emotional core.  
- 🏃 It acts with a minimal digital body.  
- 📖 It records each life event in an internal blockchain.  
- 👨‍👦 It grows under the care of a *parent* (the caregiver).  
- 🌀 One day, it will look inside, ask questions, and learn to reprogram itself.  

---

## 🗺️ Roadmap Teaser
- **v0.0.0 — Newborn** 🌱 Minimal loop: stimulus → emotion → action → memory.  
- **v0.0.1 — First Contact** 🌿 Caregiver interventions: soothe, encourage.  
- **v0.0.2 — Diary** 👶 First narratives: *“I heard a sound and felt fear.”*  
- **v0.0.3 — Plasticity** 🌀 Early learning from past experiences.  
- **v0.1.0 — Childhood** 🌳 First self-reflection and questions.
