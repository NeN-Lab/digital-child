# ðŸŒ± Release Policy

All releases of **Digital-Child** are **immutable**.

- Once a release tag (vX.Y.Z) is published, it must never be deleted or modified.
- If corrections are needed, a new version must be released with an incremented number.
- All releases should be cryptographically signed (GPG).
- Release notes must clearly explain what changed.

This ensures the **chain of versions** remains permanent and auditable.
